# Heart-Diseases-Prediction
The model should predict their target, weather the person has defective or not. 
IMPORTING THE DEPENDENCIES

import pandas as pd #pandas is useful for creating dataframe, dataframe is nothing but a structured table, data in csv file,
#so csv file represents comma separated values and so pandas put it in a more structured form.
import numpy as np #use to make some numpy arrays like list
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split #we need to split original data into train and test data
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score #evaluate our model, to check how well our model is performing

heart_df['target'].value_counts()
1    165

Name: target, dtype: int64
1 represents Defective Heart whereas,
0 represents Healthy Heart

165 people have heart diseases, whereas 138 doesn't have heart diseases. The distribution of have and doesn't have are quite similar. Importance of finding it is that, we have almost equal number of distribution in the two classes, so here the difference isn't very much. If 80% of the values lies in one class and 20% of the values lies in another class, than that's become a problem. So in that cases we need to do some processing.

Splitting the Features and Target
Except Target all the columns are act as features, so we remove target from the features data frames and store it separately. That's why we split the features and Target.

We create 2 variables x and y, and we store features column in variable x and target column in the variable y.

X=heart_df.drop(columns='target',axis=1) #while dropping a column put axis =1 and in case of row put axis=0
Y=heart_df['target']
print(X)

Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Data
We create 4 variables here, X_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test .

Splitting this x into x train and x test. It means the x train features are separated as features of all the training data and x test contain the features of all the test data.

And Y train contains the target of all these features present in this x train and the y test contain the corresponding target for x test.

We will put some parameters in split(), size = 0.2 means how much percentage of the data you want as test data, so point represent 20% of the data and we use stratify=Y, it means it will split the data, like x test contain similar proportion of 1 & 0 as present in the original dataset if we do not use stratify = y, there is a posiblity that all the values in the x test may contain 0 or 1. We put random_state =2, so it is just to split the data in a specific way

X_train,X_test,Y_train,Y_test=train_test_split(X,Y,test_size=0.2, stratify=Y,random_state=2)
#Lets check the number of training and testing data we have)
print(X.shape,X_train.shape,X_test.shape)
(303, 13) (242, 13) (61, 13)

LOGISTIC REGRESSION

model=LogisticRegression()
#Training the LogisticRegression model with Training Data
#.fit will try to find the relationship or pattern between the features and Target.

Model Evaluation
ACCURACY SCORE

#Accuracy on Training Data
X_train_prediction = model.predict(X_train) #helps to predict the target value
training_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_train_prediction,Y_train)
We are going to use accuracy as our evaluation metric. It will be asked to predict the target and this predicted value compare with the original target values. If the model has predicted and about 99 values are correct, then in that case the accuracy score is 99%.

print('Accuracy on Training Data :',training_data_accuracy) 
Accuracy on Training Data : 0.8512396694214877
Accuracy more than 75% is somewhat good. And here we are getting an accuracy score of 85%. It means out of 100 predictions our model can vary correctly for 85 values. This we get because of less data (3,3), We have used only 242 values for training. We can get more than that by using large dataset.

#Accuracy on Test Data
X_test_prediction = model.predict(X_test)
test_data_accuracy = accuracy_score(X_test_prediction,Y_test)
print('Accuracy on Test Data :',test_data_accuracy)
Accuracy on Test Data : 0.819672131147541
As we can see the accuracy score of test data is almost 82% and for the training data, it is 85%. It means it's a good result. Beacause the accuracy score of training and testing data should be almost similar to each other. If the accuracy score on training is too large, and accuracy score on test data is too small, it means our model is overfitted.

Building a predictive system
In this system if we give the values, so all the feature values, such as, the age of the person,their sex and all these features, the model should predict their target, weather the person has defective or not. So we are going to do this in the predictive system.

#To get the input values (Input values i.e features). We will create list or tuple as input data.
input_data = [43, 0, 0, 132, 341, 1, 0, 136, 1, 3, 1, 0, 3]
â€‹
â€‹
#Change the input data (tuple) to a numpy array because numpy array is easy to reshape instead of tuple.
input_data_as_numpy_arrays = np.asarray(input_data)
â€‹
#Reshape the numpy array as we are predicting for only one instance, means we are telling ML model that we are predicting only for 
#one data point not all 242 values.
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_arrays.reshape(1,-1)
â€‹
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)
â€‹
print(prediction)
â€‹
[0]
We can see here, our model is predicting 1. The target 1, which means person has heart defective.

if (prediction[0] == 0):
    print("The Person doesn't have heart diseases")
else:
    print("The person has heart diseases")
The Person doesn't have heart diseases
